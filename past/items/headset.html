			Corsair Void Pro RGB Wireless Headset
		</h1>
		<p>
			My wired headset does not have very good sound, and with the nature of my setup, having wires is very inconvenient and my headset often gets unplugged because of it.
			This new headset allows me easier mobility, and I can walk around the room while still wearing my headphones, which is amazing.

			<br>Want Level: ★★★★★★★★★☆
			<br>Price: $74.99
