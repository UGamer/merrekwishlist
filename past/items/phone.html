			Samsung Galaxy S8
		</h1>
		<p>
			This phone was a very much needed upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy S5. Most of the time it would make me wait two minutes to open an app, or just to go to my home screen. 
			This phone was leased from Sprint, the screen is beautiful, and it can process very fast. Thank you very much Mom and Dad!
			<br>
			<br>Want Level: ★★★★★★★★★★
			<br>Price: $28.00 per month for 18 months @ Sprint, $672.00 full; I pay half
