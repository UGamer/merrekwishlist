			Samsung Galaxy S8 Clear Otterbox Case
		</h1>
		<p>
			This is to protect my phone. I wanted a clear case because I plan on putting skins on the actual phone itself. A very interesting design, quite impressive actually.
			The case does not have a raised bezel around the sides of the screen, but has bumpers on the front and bottom of the phone to protect the whole phone.
			<br>
			<br>Want Level: ★★★★★★★★★★
			<br>Price: $16.21
