			Samsung Galaxy S8
		</h1>
		<p>
			My current phone is horrible. Most of the time it will make me wait two minutes to open an app, or just to go to my home screen. 
			I picked this phone due to the fact that it can be leased from Sprint, the screen is beautiful, and it can process very fast. However, I would recommend buying it refurbised from Amazon at full price
			<br>
			<br>Want Level: ★★★★★★★★★★
			<br>Price: $534.95 refurb. full @ Amazon / $28.00 per month @ Sprint, $672 full
			<br>Delivery Time: 1 to 2 days / In-Store Pickup</p>
