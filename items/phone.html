			Samsung Galaxy S8

		<p>
			My current phone is horrible. Most of the time it will make me wait two minutes to open an app, or just to go to my home screen. 
			I picked this phone due to the fact that it can be leased from Sprint, the screen is beautiful, and it can process very fast.
			<br>
			<br>Want Level: ★★★★★★★★★★
			<br>Price: $534.95 refurb. full @ Amazon
			<br>Delivery Time: Probably best to pick up in store.</p>
